<h1>Trinity Mathematical Society meetings</h1>
<p>This list (up to meeting 524b) was compiled from the original minutes
by Paul Taylor, September 1981.  It was scanned, edited and extended
by Joseph Myers, November 2002 onwards; the list up to 1981 is
reproduced from that in the front of the minutes book in REC.11.10 in
the Wren Library by permission of Paul Taylor and the Wren Library.
</p>
<p>Meeting numbers and page numbers in the minutes were last obtained
from the Secretary for 2003–4.  Thus, subsequent meeting numbers
should be considered provisional and subject to correction to match
the actual numbers used in the minutes of subsequent meetings, and
page numbers for meetings from 2004–5 onwards (and audience figures
for those meetings where available) need to be obtained from the
Secretary and added to the list.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jsm28/tms-meetings">source code</a>
for generating this version of the list is available.</p>

<li>14 October 2002: Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers">W. T. Gowers</a>, “A Handful of Unsolved Problems”.<br>
Abstract: If you are not a research mathematician, you may find it hard to imagine just how much is not known. Of course, there are a few famous unsolved problems (the Riemann hypothesis, Goldbach’s conjecture and the like) but I shall not be discussing those. Instead, I shall look at questions that are much less well-known but still interesting and more representative of the sort of mathematics that goes on behind the headlines.<br>

Abstract: The talk will explain how recent observations have dramatically confirmed modern cosmological theory, based on general relativity. I will then review the most popular model for the origin of the big bang, inflationary theory, and a new model we have recently developed, the cyclic universe model, based on notions from M theory. An observational test to discriminate inflation from the cyclic model using measurements of the polarisation of the microwave sky will be explained.<br>

Abstract: In 1905, Lorentz posed the problem of studying the behaviour of light particles when moving through a field of heavier particles. This has led over the last 30 years to a collection of very interesting, beautiful, and hard problems for mathematicians, only few of which have been solved. The speaker will summarise such problems, and try to explain why they are so hard.<br>

Abstract: Suppose that seven students have agreed to share a house with seven rooms. The total rent is fixed, but they have to agree on both the allocation of rent to each room and on the allocation of rooms to residents. I will sketch a proof that, subject to some fairly natural conditions, this can be done in such a way that no student will want to move to another room.<br>

Abstract: Is maths (as opposed to simple arithmetic) actually relevant to people in the real world? Does it matter whether it is or not anyway? I’ll describe a few examples, some well-known and others obscure – but all interesting or (with any luck) amusing – of where maths has been crucial in solving real-world problems.<br>

Abstract: Generations of even well-educated adults are under the delusion that mathematics is difficult, and that mathematicians must therefore be very clever. In this talk I will explode this myth and show that mathematics is in fact easy, and moreover that mathematics is precisely “that which is easy” for an appropriate sense of ‘easy’. We will take ‘easy’ to mean ‘attainable by logical thought processes’. As a corollary, or a converse, or a contrapositive or something, we will discuss the importance of illogical thought processes in non-mathematical life and the fact that life is thus difficult. Hence or otherwise we will deduce that mathematics is not life, nor can it nor should it be.<br>

<li>11 October 2004: Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers">W. T. Gowers</a>, “How to think of complicated proofs of simple theorems”.<br>
Abstract: All too often in lectures and books about mathematics, one is simply told a theorem and its proof. This can leave important questions unanswered, such as the following: why should one bother with the theorem, does the proof have certain unavoidable features (this question one may feel particularly acutely if it is long and complicated), and how did anybody think of the proof in the first place? These questions matter because if you can answer them then you understand the theorem in a completely different and much better way. I shall spend this talk attempting to demystify at least one theorem, and encouraging you to think in a similarly critical way about all the mathematics you learn.<br>

Abstract: G.H. Hardy and J.E. Littlewood are two of Trinity’s most famous mathematicians. I shall talk about some of their work, a great deal of which is still highly relevant today.

<li>24 January 2005: Mr S. L. Webster, “Unanswered Questions in Cosmology”.<br>
Abstract: Cosmology is the study of the dynamics of the Universe as a whole and is, therefore, a subject inevitably riddled with conjecture and unsolved mysteries. Whilst one can make a surprising amount of progress with conventional physics, many fundamental questions remain unanswered, not least where the Universe came from and why it exhibits such remarkable symmetry. I shall give a brief introduction to cosmology, without dwelling on technicalities, before outlining some of these problems and some of the more modern ideas (such as inflation) that go a small way towards solving them.<br>

<li>7 February 2005: Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Perry_(physicist)">M. J. Perry</a>, “M Theory”.<br>
Abstract: A principal goal of fundamental physics has been a unified picture of all of the interactions: gravitational, electromagnetic and strong and weak nuclear forces. Progress towards this goal led to the spectacular development of quantum field theory in the last century. However, a picture emerged that could not contain gravity. String theory provided partial answers to this problem, but the appearance of various magical coincidences led to the development of a series of ideas known as M theory. M theory contains all string theories as different faces of the same fundamental object although the precise details remain unknown.<br>

Abstract: Sometimes natural geometric questions in low dimensions can be hard. Despite being much harder to visualize, things can be easier with lots of dimensions. There are ways of replacing some difficult low-dimensional problems with easier high-dimensional ones. These ideas lead naturally to the construction of spectra, the abstract objects that many algebraic topologists really spend their time thinking about.

Abstract: Suppose you are given a number n and asked to determine whether it is prime. One time-honoured method is to see whether it is a multiple of 2, then of 3, then of 5, and so on, all the way up to the square root of n. This works fine for a number such as 147, but is not very practical if n has a hundred digits, say. A related problem, of great importance in cryptography, is to factorize a large integer that somebody gives you. Again, it can be done by simply searching through all the primes until you stumble on a factor, but again this takes far too long if the number is large. It is not at all obvious how one might go about finding faster approaches to these computational tasks. However, some very clever techniques have been discovered, and some of these are not especially hard to understand. This talk will present a few of them.<br>

Abstract: Many aspects of weather and climate can be understood by considering idealised models and using basic physical principles together with standard mathematical techniques used in all branches of applied mathematics. This talk will explore the mathematics behind the weather and climate by exploring two case studies which display rather different physics. The first is that of winter storms that hit the UK, and second is the El Nino phenomena which dominates the year-to-year variability of weather over much of the Pacific region. Understanding the physical mechanisms which drive these weather features and their sensitivity to changes allows us to make short-term forecasts and longer-term climate predictions.<br>

But there are many important situations where the system is ultimately stable, but which can act as a powerful amplifier for a long period of time. The situation is particularly important when the system has a long spatial extent, so that these non-instabilities (convective instabilities) can produce large amplitude structures which can be sustained by small amounts of noise. In contrast, when the system is absolutely unstable no noise is needed to sustain the structures. This dichotomy is related to the behaviour of linear dynamical systems with non-normal matrices.<br>

Then I will explain a method to investigate the effects the Ricci Flow has on the straight lines of our (not straight at all) space.<br>

Abstract: The sum S of k sets of integers A_1,A_2,…,A_k is defined as S=A_1+A_2+…+A_k={a_1+…+a_k:a_i∈A_i for every i}. For non-empty finite sets A_i, it is easily seen that the size |S| of the sum is at least |A_1|+…+|A_k|-k+1. There are similar classical inequalities for subsets of additive groups – indeed, such an equality was proved by Cauchy and rediscovered by Davenport. In the talk, aimed at first year undergraduates, we shall consider some related inequalities concerning the minima and maxima of set sums. For example, given |A_1+A_2|, |A_1+A_3| and |A_2+A_3|, what can we say about the sum of the three sets? As we shall see, these problems are intimately connected to inequalities involving the volumes of “canonical” projections of a body in R^k.<br>

Abstract: The last decade has seen huge advances in our understanding of the makeup and history of the universe. Some properties of the universe – its geometry and the nature of the primordial density inhomogeneities – are astonishingly simple. Other properties – like the existence of dark energy – are very hard to reconcile with standard cosmology. And the cosmic singularity from which everything emerged remains a deep mystery. I will discuss a radical new approach, the cyclic model, based on ideas from string theory and M theory, which explains the observations without invoking a period of cosmic inflation. I will describe how future observations could distinguish the inflationary and cyclic models.<br>

Abstract: Russell and Whitehead famously avoided the paradoxes by regimenting sets (and languages) into disjoint levels in a system called Type Theory. Over the years this approach and the Zermelo-Fraenkel approach have diverged greatly; since the ZF approach is much better known there are now some interesting backwaters which invite closer attention than they usually get. This talk will be an introduction to the descendents of type theory and will try to make connections with other themes in the philosophy of mathematics.<br>

<li>18 February 2008: Dr T. A. Fisher, “Local-to-global principles in number theory”.<br>
Abstract: An important source of problems in number theory is the study of Diophantine equations, i.e. systems of (usually polynomial) equations that must be solved in integers or rational numbers. One hope is that these “global” problems can be attacked by putting together “local” information, that is by looking at the problem one prime at a time (and over the reals). This works particularly well for quadratic forms, but generalisations are surprisingly hard to come by.<br>

<li>3 March 2008: Dr R. B. Gramacy, “Designing Supercomputer Experiments”.<br>
Abstract: Computer experiments often require dense sweeps over input parameters to obtain a qualitative understanding of their response. However, such sweeps are unnecessary in regions where the response is easily predicted; well-chosen designs could allow a mapping of the response with far fewer simulation runs. I explore a modern approach that couples two standard regression models: Gaussian processes and treed partitioning. A Bayesian perspective yields an explicit measure of (nonstationary) predictive uncertainty that can be used to guide sampling. The methods will be illustrated through several examples, including a motivating example which involves the computational fluid dynamics of a NASA re-entry vehicle.<br>

Abstract: The study of knots and links of curves in ordinary 3-dimensional space is an easily visualisable example of topology as ‘flexible geometry’. Knots are divided into various classes, tabulations are produced, yet (as with prime numbers) no real classification seems feasible. Even telling whether two knots are really different can be tricky.<br>

Abstract: Modern financial theory tells us that prices of options are given by expectations of the payoffs with respect to some pricing measure, typically written as infinite dimensional integrals of some functional against Wiener measure. The fast and accurate numerical evaluation of such integrals is an ongoing challenge. I will explain some recent ideas based on the Lie group structure of iterated integrals. The resulting “cubature” formulae can be traced back to no one less than Sir Isaac Newton.<br>

Abstract: When physical systems with many symmetries become unstable, the result is a pattern with fewer symmetries. But typically there are an infinite number of such patterns, and the selection between them is due to nonlinear effects. Many cases can be understood by means of ‘equivariant bifurcation theory’. I will give a brief discussion of this with some common examples of patterns that can be predicted on symmetry grounds.<br>

Abstract: Mathematics is the language that describes the natural world, but it is sometimes a bit hard to read the handwriting. In this talk, I will introduce the concept of ‘dimensional analysis’ as a very powerful tool for understanding the key quantities of interest in a range of physical situations. A particularly famous and appropriate example is the accurate estimation of the (classified) yield of the Trinity nuclear test by the Trinity mathematician G. I. Taylor using (declassified) photographs. I will also discuss some closely related techniques for the identification of ‘similarity solutions’ which often manage to capture the important features of a physical system with surprisingly little mathematical heavy lifting.<br>

Abstract: A Bayesian perspective allows probability theory to be used as a formalism for epistemic uncertainty: ie a measure of our confidence in a current or past state of the world about which we are ignorant (although someone else might know the truth). This allows probability to be used to quantify our uncertainty about a suspect’s guilt, the image on the Turin shroud, the average effect of a medical treatment, or whether Jane Austen died before Napoleon. I will look at how these ideas have developed and are being used in practice, and how scoring rules can be used to assess how well you can quantify your doubt.

Both physicists and philosophers disagree about the extent to which we can understand large-scale or complex phenomena in terms of their microscopic parts. Examples include everyday phenomena, like the freezing and boiling of liquids, and fancy ideas like fractals. I will pour some oil on these troubled waters by arguing that many cases exemplify both emergence and reduction.<br>

I will explain how the integers arise in Nature and explain that they are emergent objects, no more fundamental than the concept of smell. I will also comment on the yet-to-be-discovered laws of physics and provide some (admittedly circumstantial) evidence that they are not based on the integers.

Abstract: It is a remarkable phenomenon in nature and in mathematics that the statistical behaviour of large complex systems are often governed by _universal laws_ that, miraculously, are almost completely independent of the microscopic mechanics of such systems. Well known examples of such universal laws include the laws of thermodynamics, Benford’s law, and the central limit theorem; the zeroes of the zeta function are also conjectured to be governed by another universal law arising from random matrix theory. We will survey some of these laws, including some recent theoretical developments by several authors (including the speaker) that have rigorously established universality for some random matrix models.<br>

<li>21 February 2011: Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hyland">J. M. E. Hyland</a>, “Quadratic algebras and operads”.<br>
Abstract: Algebras are vector spaces equipped with a multiplication (for example, the cross product in 3-space). Quadratic algebras are a special class of algebra with a duality theory involving the so-called dual numbers. The dual numbers give the algebra of differentiation. One can pass from algebras to suitable algebraic theories, called operads. There is a notion of a ‘quadratic operad’ with an analogous rich theory involving Lie algebras. Using examples, I shall try to explain some of this and its significance.<br>

<li>7 March 2011: Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nickl">R. Nickl</a>, “Gauss’ invention of the method of least squares and the normal distribution, and its impact on the mathematical foundations of statistics”.<br>
Abstract: Even after C.F. Gauss had published the Disquistiones Arithmeticae, that contain some of his most fundamental number-theoretical work, in 1801, he was known only to specialists in Europe. This changed drastically after he predicted, late in 1801, the position of the planet Ceres after it had ‘disappeared behind the sun’. Gauss immediately achieved fame throughout Europe. A technique that Gauss used in this prediction, as well as in much of his subsequent observational work, was the method of least squares to correct ‘intrinsic’ measurement errors in an efficient way. This method, in conjunction with the normal or ‘Gaussian’ distribution, has been a cornerstone of modern statistics ever since, reaching into the foundations of likelihood-based inference. I shall discuss the main mathematical and methodological ideas behind Gauss’ invention and trace some key aspects of its history into the 21st century, highlighting a variety of key statistical ideas that derive from it.<br>

<li>24 October 2011: Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoubin_Ghahramani">Z. Ghahramani</a>, “Probabilistic Learning Machines and the Information Revolution”.<br>
Abstract: Information plays a central role in 21st century science, commerce and society. We have huge data sets of measurements collected from large-scale scientific experiments, exciting commercial opportunities arising from exploiting web-scale information, and vast stores of knowledge available to society on the internet. Probabilistic approaches for modelling uncertainty and learning from data are essential to the effective use of these vast stores of information. Modern probabilistic approaches to building learning machines are grounded in the mathematics of the 18th century Reverend Thomas Bayes. I will describe the foundations of this field and our recent work on stochastic processes and nonparametric statistics, along with examples of a number of applications to big data problems such as information retrieval, recommendation, genomic data analysis, financial prediction, and robotics.<br>

Abstract: Are there any rational solutions to x²+y²=-1? No, because there are no real solutions. How about x²+y²=3? Again the answer is no, but one way of showing this is by constructing a ‘local field’ — the 3-adic numbers — which contains the rationals as a dense subfield, and in which it’s easy to check that there are no solutions. It is far easier to solve equations in these local fields than in global fields such as the rationals, and conversely, sometimes solutions in all local fields can imply solutions in a global field too.<br>

<li>21 November 2011: Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Berloff">N. G. Berloff</a>, “Superfluid states of matter: from superfluid helium to polariton condensates”.<br>
Abstract: When in 1937 liquid helium was first observed to flow with negligible viscosity through a narrow gap, it was clear that, at low temperatures, helium was different from ordinary fluids. The attemps to understand this phenomenon (called superfluidity by Pyotr Kapitza) led to the development of a two-fluid theory by Lev Landau. In this theory the fluid is modelled as an interacting mixture of  superfluid and normal fluid components. In more recent times, an aspect of superfluidity that has been emphasized as most central is that the superfluid velocity is associated with the gradient of the phase of the macroscopic classical complex-valued matter field. Such a description impies that the system possesses a Bose–Einstein condensate (a form of matter that emerges when particles collapse into the same lowest-energy state) — with the matter field being the condensate wavefunction — and, therefore, can be described by a nonlinear equation for classical waves, known as the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This description has the ingredients necessary to produce many of the aspects of superfluidity, such as frictionless flow below the Landau critical velocity, two-fluid hydrodynamics, quantized vortices, and  metastable persistent flow in a doughnut-shaped geometry. These features of superfluidity have been experimentally observed not only in liquid helium, but also in ultracold gases and very recently in condensates of semiconductor microcavity polaritons — entities comprising both matter and light. How the condensate model can be modified and applied to study the dynamics of these various superfluid systems is the subject of my talk.<br>

<li>20 February 2012: Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Paternain">G. P. Paternain</a>, “Contact geometry in dynamics: the 3-body problem”.<br>
Abstract: We have known for a long time how to write down the equations of motion of a satellite that moves under the influence of the gravitational fields of the Earth and the Moon, but surprisingly, we still do not fully understand the long term behaviour of the satellite since we cannot explicitly solve the equations. At the end of the 19th century, Poincare noticed the presence of chaos in the system and kick-started the modern theory of dynamical systems. Recently a new type of geometry called contact geometry (the odd dimensional relative of symplectic geometry) has been proposed as a tool for understanding this old problem in celestial mechanics. In the talk I will try to explain what contact geometry is and why it is relevant for the 3-body problem.<br>

<li>Prof. Lord <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees">M. J. Rees</a>, “From Planets to Universes”.<br>
Abstract: Improved astronomical instruments have revealed a rich variety of new phenomena: most stars are known to be orbited by retinues of planets; huge black holes lurk in the centres of galaxies; the dominant force in the expanding universe is a mysterious ‘push’ that overcomes normal gravity. Computer simulations are now powerful and realistic enough to be crucial in modelling these phenomena. To extend the limits of our understanding will require a ‘unified’ theory—and we need to take seriously the idea that space is hugely more extensive than the domain we can actually observe.</li>
<li>Mr L. Z. Zhao, “Branching-selection processes”.<br>
Abstract: Branching processes with selection can be seen as a probabilistic genetic model for fixed populations. In this talk, I shall concentrate on a class of particle systems first investigated by Eric Brunet and Bernard Derrida in 1997, introducing the model as well as a discussion as to some of the results and expected results I have been working on this past year.</li>
<li>Mr B. Barber, “Compressions in Extremal Combinatorics”.<br>
Abstract: How big can a family of finite sets satisfying some property be? One obstacle to answering this type of question is a lack of structure. Compressions are one way of imposing structure on families of sets. What are they, and what can we use them to find out?</li>
<li>Mr K. Wong, “The Past, the Future and Elsewhere: a Geometric Excursion into Spacetime”.<br>
Abstract: Applied mathematicians rationalise about the natural world in terms of cause and effect. Causality imposes a geometric ordering on the fabric of space and time.

Abstract: Ordinals were the last acquisition by the Mathematical Zoo for the Number House, a donation by Cantor in the late 19th century. Unlike naturals, integers, rationals, reals and complexes they can be infinite as well as finite, and therein lies much of their interest. In this talk I shall explain where they come from, what they can do for you, and why (despite their being infinite) you (a mere finite being) need to worry about them.</li>

<li>Ms R. Newton, “Local Reciprocity: a Mysterious Map from Number Theory”.<br>
Abstract: I will start by defining the p-adic numbers, the classic example of a local field. I will go on to state the existence of the local reciprocity map and describe the cases for which an explicit formula has been found. I will end by trying to explain what makes it difficult to compute local reciprocity in the remaining cases.</li>
<li>Mr P. Ford, “Freezing”.<br>
Abstract: We will take a whistlestop tour of some of the physics involved in ice formation in oceans, rivers and Antarctica; this will range from turbulent convection to the slow viscous flow of glaciers.

<li>Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicky_Neale">V. R. Neale</a>, “Adding Integers”.<br>
Abstract: There are many fascinating questions that one can ask about adding integers. Some of these have been answered, some are open problems, and some have not even been asked yet. A common feature of many of these questions is that they are easy to ask, yet potentially difficult to answer, and finding an answer may use tools from a number of areas of mathematics. I shall try to give a flavour of some of the problems that have been asked (both answered and unanswered), leaving the audience to think of their own unasked questions.</li>
<li>Mr A. D. J. Shannon, “What’s the Point?”.<br>
Abstract: he notion of a ‘point’ in geometry seems fairly basic, but during the 20th century a generalised and abstracted notion provided much new insight and intuition. More recently, studying some of the mathematical ideas underlying theoretical physics has led mathematicians to consider so-called non-commutative geometry. ‘Spaces’ in this setting have algebras of functions on them which are non-commutative, but there is no actual classical geometric space underlying them! However, the generalised notion of a point does allow one to develop a certain amount of geometric intuition. In this talk, I shall explain the modern point of view on points in algebraic geometry, and explain in some examples how this allows one to study non-commutative algebras in a way that resembles what we might normally consider geometry.</li>
<li>Mr M. Chiodo, “Decision Problems in Group Theory”.<br>
Abstract: Around the 1930’s, Alan Turing developed the concept of a Turing machine, the basic framework for what would eventually become modern computation. However, this construction rests on a paradox: such machines cannot always compute their own future behaviour. Such classes of problems are referred to as “incomputable”, and they appear in many areas of mathematics, from set theory, to algebra, and even to geometry and topology. In this talk I will give an overview of Turing’s construction, outline how this gives rise to some incomputable problems in group theory, and give examples of some corresponding incomputable problems in geometry.</li>

I will discuss the history of this theorem and a couple of proofs of it. After that I will hint at some more recent work which establishes that there must in fact be at least n/2 ordinary lines for all sufficiently large enough n.

Abstract: Melting of the great ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland has the potential to raise sea level significantly. Whereas many inland ice sheets are controlled by a balance between accumulation of snow at high altitudes and melting at low altitudes, marine ice sheets, which flow into the ocean, are controlled dynamically by the rate at which ice detaches from the submarine bedrock along which it flows to form floating ice shelves. Fundamental aspects of the flow of marine ice sheets can be understood using viscous fluid dynamics. I shall describe recent laboratory and mathematical studies of marine ice sheets, which are helping us to understand what controls them from collapse.<br>

<li>18 February 2013: Dr J. Goedecke, “Abstraction in Mathematics”.<br>
Abstract: The word abstraction often sounds daunting to many non-mathematicians, and probably also to some mathematicians. However, abstraction is all around us: not only in mathematics, but also in the way we form terms and concepts in our language. For example we all group together houses, schools, college chapels and skyscrapers under the word “building”. So if we know something that is common to all buildings (for example that they have to be maintained), then we know this for every building we meet without having to work it out anew in each case. Mathematics builds heavily on abstraction. Some even say that abstraction is the main ingredient in mathematics. I will present some examples of mathematical concepts that arise as abstractions of well-known situations which every undergraduate has met. My research area – category theory – can be called the most abstract area of mathematics. We will try to explore the point of view and underlying principles that drive category theorists to their very abstract way of thinking.<br>

<li>Mr K. Wong, “Even physicists use group theory!”.<br>
Abstract: An ex-IMO mathmo once explained to me that mathematical knowledge is divided into the good (pure), the bad (methods) and the ugly (physics). Obviously it was thought that cute ideas like group theory are purely recreational and have no place in the ugly business of modelling the real world. The reality is rather different. Theoretical physics is a quest for beauty, and symmetry is its guiding principle. In this talk, I’ll show you how group theory is used to solve mechanics problems where symmetry plays a role. This talk should be accessible to first years – I’ll assume that you vaguely recognise the words “group” and “vector space” but I’ll introduce representation theory from scratch in an intuitive way.</li>
<li>Mr H. Funakoshi, “Simulating Quantum Mechanics on Computers”.<br>
Abstract: There are many physical situations which are heavily influenced by quantum mechanical effects, which we just can’t deal with analytically. This raises the question: while it might be (relatively) obvious how to do simulations involving classical physics, for example as with computational fluid dynamics, how might one go about simulating quantum mechanical systems on computers? I’ll begin by describing the path integral picture of quantum mechanics, and then demonstrate that by looking at the resulting formulae in the right way, we end up with various probabilistic methods of doing such computations.</li>

Abstract: Szemeredi’s regularity lemma is a powerful tool in combinatorics, and has been described as a “structure theorem for graphs”. Both the statement and the proof can seem rather unenlightening—unless you see the analogy with some very well-known results in analysis and probability. More precisely, regularity is what you get when you take the proofs of these results and accidentally try to run them in a finite world. I’ll try to present this picture while finding time to say what regularity is good for, and maybe touch on the machinery of compactness and ultrafilters that does all this stuff for you.</li>

Getting to know some of them well, following their progress through PhD’s, or not, on into the working world, in academia or out, has given me a chance to observe what the employment options are in this difficult economic climate. Difficult, but exciting too, in that as a group, Cambridge mathematics students, undergraduates, Part III’s and PhD’s have considerable influence. It’s a time when using that potential to best advantage could make a real difference to the relationship between mathematics and other areas of technological research. Using that potential, making that difference, does require a bit of thought. I will talk about some of the trends I have seen, how they might develop, and invite you to start thinking.</li>
<li>Ms K. Wan, “Tails of our ancestors”.<br>
Abstract: In the beginning… {insert favorite deity here} created the universe, and with it life started with tiny microscopic organisms. It soon transpired that locomotion in general, and swimming in particular, was a good idea. So these microorganisms evolved tails, which they moved around to propel themselves in their fluid environments. These tails are what Biologists call “cilia and flagella”, made up of microtubules and motor proteins, but to the logical eye of the mathematician these are fascinating, nonlinear structures which are subject to large-amplitude deformations and stochastic periodic actuation. We ask the question, how can one use the wisdom of mathematics, to better appreciate the wisdom of Nature?</li>

I want my talk to be accessible to everyone, so I intend to start very basic, but will hopefully have time to include some examples from fields such as knot theory and homotopy theory.</li>
<li>Mr S. Loesch, “Programming Languages, Treated Formally”.<br>
Abstract: Ever since the first computer programs were written, programming errors have been a fundamental problem for developers as well as users. They cause computers to crash, medical equipment to malfunction and rockets to explode. To make sure that a program is free of error, one can run it to test if it behaves correctly. In practice however, programs have infinitely many possible inputs and behaviours. Alternatively one can try to formally verify by rigorous mathematics that a program is correct. To give this a sound basis, one has to formally define what a program (of a certain programming language) is and what it actually does. In my talk I will explain how this can be done and give an overview of the general research area.</li>
<li>Mr D. Civin, “Noether, Bruhat, Morawetz”.<br>
Abstract: I will present a brief, non-technical overview of how the geometry of a physical system can be used to predict its evolution in time. In particular, I will focus on Einstein’s Field Equations which describe the physical phenomenon of gravitation. After a (very) short description and history of the general theory of relativity, I’ll go on to discuss the pivotal contributions of three mathematicians to this theory, namely Emmy Noether, Yvonne Fouret-Bruhat and Cathleen Morawetz.</li>
<li>Mr Z. L. Low, “The Humble Arrow in Mathematics”.<br>
Abstract: There are two prominent notions in mathematics denoted by an arrow: one is the idea of a mapping from one sort of thing to another, and the other is implication. Prima facie, these two notions seem rather unrelated, but in fact there is a deep connection between the two which manifests itself in several different ways. The fundamental idea came from the Brouwerian school of intuitionism and has since been developed from an informal principle into various rigorous equivalences, and it remains a topic of research even today.</li>
<li>Dr H. Hunt, “The remarkable accuracy of the Trinity College Clock”.<br>
Abstract: The Trinity Clock in Great Court is quite a prominent feature of the college, at least to look at. And it has a rather curious way of announcing the hours, once for Trinity and a second time for St John’s. It is always within a second or two of the correct time and yet it hardly ever requires adjustment. Does this mean that the mechanism is unaffected by the elements? What about temperature, pressure, humidity? And does the gravitational pull of the moon make any difference? The pendulum on the Trinity Clock has been instrumented to measure period and amplitude to great accuracy. The time is compared with UTC obtained from a GPS receiver. All of this data is streamed continuously to the web at http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/. If you thought that the physics of a pendulum was simple, then think again!</li>

Abstract: It is difficult to follow the evolution of a cancer over large numbers of cell divisions. Instead of using direct measurements, it is possible to infer features of this evolution from indirect measurements such as patterns of mutations in the tumour. I will give an overview of two stochastic processes that arise in understanding tumour heterogeneity, the spatial structure of mutations in tumour cells. Time allowing, I will describe how Approximate Bayesian Computation can be used for inference in this setting. Biological context will be provided!<br>

<li>28 October 2013: Dr H. Hunt, “Maths problems in Engineering—handling infinity”.<br>
Abstract: I am an engineer who uses a lot of maths. One of the difficulties I encounter regularly is dealing with zero and infinity, because these are abstract concepts (nothing in the real world is infinite, and nothing that exists is zero). Mathematical models are comfortable with zero and infinity, for instance Hooke’s law for springs – the spring can extend to infinity, and the maths says that a bouncing ball will bounce an infinite number of times before stopping. As for zero, an infinite wire of finite mass has zero width. But there is more. Can we assume that a rail (on a train track) is infinitely long? This is a useful assumption for sound radiation. What about a power cable between its supports – can that be thought of as infinite? A lot hinges on the answers to the integral over sin and cos from 0 to infinity, which are 1 and 0 respectively. An engineer can prove these results very simply.<br>

Abstract: Powerful well-designed randomized controlled trials together with intelligence gleaned from the clinical follow-up of research cohorts of HIV-infected patients have transformed the life expectancy of HIV-infected persons from less than 10 years in the 1980s to the loss of 10 years from life-expectancy in the 21st century. By contrast, Scotland lost more lives to opiate-related deaths in the five years from 2006–2010 than to HIV /AIDS in 30 years. Why? To what extent do pharmacological or criminal justice interventions reduce opiate-related deaths? How do we find out…?

Abstract: Whenever one thinks of problems that have occupied the attention of mathematicians for centuries, number theoretic problems spring to mind: Fermat’s Last Theorem, Goldbach’s Conjecture, and the Twin Primes Conjecture. But, as it happens, there are some problems of geometry which, in various incarnations, have been around for two millennia. In the talk I shall present a number of results about such problems, starting with results obtained in antiquity and the Middle Ages, continuing with theorems of Cauchy and Cayley, and ending with some recent results and unsolved problems. The talk will be accessible to freshmen, but will hold challenges for research students as well.<br>

For decades there has been speculation about the origins of the synchronization seen in nature, but it is only recently that theory and experiments (mostly carried out here in DAMTP ) have combined to provide quantitative analysis of this problem.

Abstract: The Sun should be at the peak of its activity cycle, but actually it has been rather feeble. Several solar space observatories have been watching the Sun over the past few years: SoHO, Stereo, Hinode, SDO and IRIS . We now have high spatial and spectral resolution images of the Sun, with a high cadence. This talk will review what we have learnt about the active Sun, in particular what we know (and don’t yet know!) about solar active regions and flares, and how they might affect the Earth’s environment (via space weather).<br>

Abstract: Bootstrap percolation is a cellular automaton used to describe the spread of an infection.

<li>Mr A. Dutta, “Stability of Predictive Control without Terminal Conditions”.<br>
Abstract: The stability of constrained finite horizon optimal control problem has been widely addressed in the literature in (1) state-space formulation and by (2) inclusion of terminal constraints, terminal cost, terminal control law. In my research, both these restrictions are removed i.e. stability is ensured for (1) input-output formulation and (2) without any of the three stabilizing ingredients. In this case, the predictive controller is certified by proving infinite feasibility of the problem through set invariance.</li>

<li>Ms J. French, “Counting your way to Quantum Groups”.<br>
Abstract: We will start by looking at how counting certain sequences of maps allows us to define a multiplication on the isomorphism classes of objects of a category with some conditions.

<li>Mr J. Lloyd, “How to build an automatic Statistician”.<br>
Abstract: I will present the beginnings of an automatic statistician, which has the potential to aid in the exploratory analysis of data. Specifically, I will discuss a system which can build statistical models in an open-ended language of models and then describe them in natural language. I will briefly review the class of regression models which the system constructs and how their properties allow for a modular description generation algorithm. The talk will conclude with examples of the output of the system and a discussion of future research directions.</li>
<li>Mr W. Sonnex, “Dependent Type Theory”.<br>
Abstract: What is a mathematical proof as a mathematical object? How do we axiomatize mathematics so that computers can check our proofs, or construct their own (my research)? This talk answers these questions using Dependent Type Theory, and I will show how complex modern mathematics can be built out of this simple starting language (all checked by a computer too). At the end I will discuss some of the exciting recent developments in Homotopy Type Theory.</li>
<li>Mr M. Grayling, “Phase II Clinical Trial Designs: Then and Now”.<br>
Abstract: Over the past few decades, clinicians have been forced to deal with a revolution in the proposed procedures for the progression of a drug through phase II trials. Historically, a single-arm phase II design, in which all patients receive the experimental treatment, was employed as the principal way to determine whether to proceed to a randomised controlled phase III trial. However, single-arm trials are commonly associated with high type-I error rates, as well as biased estimated treatment effects. As a result, it has become increasingly clear that this classical phase II design performs poorly in predicting the likelihood of phase III success. Consequently, there has been much interest recently in the use of randomised phase II designs, and a more commonly accepted phase II development plan today has become to utilize a single-arm designed trial, followed by a pilot randomised study if the null hypothesis is rejected at the single-arm stage. In my talk, I will detail how the most common single-arm and randomised two-arm trials are optimally designed and the roles each play today, before discussing a simple way in which the expected sample size of the single-arm followed by randomised two-arm development plan may be reduced over current practice.</li>
<li>Mr G. Peng, “Viscous Peeling of an Elastic Sheet”.<br>
Abstract: When viscous fluid is injected in the gap between an elastic sheet and a rigid base plate, the sheet peels away from the base at a speed which depends on various factors. In this talk, I will describe how to model this problem mathematically using lubrication theory, and how to solve it using a matched asymptotic expansion. The method generalizes to yield over 50 different asymptotic solutions for spreading of viscous fluid under an elastic sheet.</li>

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in the vacuum play an important role in fundamental physics. In this talk, I will show that these fluctuations get stretched to cosmic scales if the early universe experienced a period of inflationary expansion. Using little more than the quantum mechanics of a simple harmonic oscillator, I will compute this effect and explain how it provides the primordial seeds for all structure in the universe. I will show how these predictions compare to recent observations of the cosmic microwave background. Finally, I will speculate about the physical cause for the inflationary expansion.<br>

Abstract: Every well-educated fresher has already been indoctrinated with the right answer to this question: reals are either algebraic or transcendental. Algebraic numbers are obviously fantastic. By contrast, the transcendental numbers are utterly hideous and deserve no attention whatsoever, with the two exceptions of pi and e (bless their little cotton socks). Contrary to this received opinion, I’ll explain why it should be a major goal of 21st-century mathematics to reclaim more of the reals for explicit use by mathematicians, and I’ll tell you about some difficult problems that need to be solved along the way.<br>

Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider is about to start operation again at a higher energy at the beginning of 2015. I shall introduce the machine, particle physics and the discovery of the Higgs boson. Standard theory predicts that the quantum fluctuations should make the Higgs boson much heavier than it is observed to be, but a speculative theory of particle physics (supersymmetry) explains why the quantum fluctuations are small. This theory predicts a host of new particles for the LHC to find. There were a few small anomalies in LHC data already that can be interpreted as the production of certain supersymmetric particles. Such interpretations are ready for further experimental testing next year.<br>

Abstract:  will describe several simple and natural random systems which exist on the two-dimensional infinite square grid. Often there is a “critical point” for these systems. At this point, it has been predicted for more than 30 years that these systems acquire an unexpected symmetry: invariance under conformal transformations of the complex plane. I will explain what that means, discuss some examples, and try to convey a few ideas about remarkable progress which has taken place in the last 15 years to describe these objects rigorously, notably Schramm’s famous SLE random curves.<br>

Abstract: Solving a mathematics problem that is not a routine exercise can often feel more like an art than a science. Different people attack problems in different ways, and ideas can appear to spring into one’s mind from nowhere. I shall argue that solving problems is a much more systematic process than it appears, and shall also try to explain why, if that is the case, it has the features that make us think that it isn’t. For the bulk of the talk, I shall attempt, with help from the audience, to solve an Olympiad-style problem that I have not seen before, and to do so systematically rather than by waiting for a clever idea to appear out of the blue. The attempt is not guaranteed to succeed, but I hope that it will be informative whether or not it does.<br>

Abstract: The question of how to split a prize purse between position prizes in a contest has a long and rich history going all the way back to the work by Galton (1902). The economists’ approach to this question is to assume that contestants strategically invest efforts aiming at selfishly maximizing their payoffs, which combine in some way the value of winning a prize and the cost of production. How should a contest owner split a prize purse with the goal of maximizing the expected total effort in an equilibrium? What if the goal is to maximize the expected maximum individual effort?<br>

Abstract: The Banach-Tarski Paradox is the counter-intuitive fact that a sphere can be cut into finitely many pieces and reassembled into two copies of itself. Of course, you can’t do this in real life, but it’s more than just a curiosity. In fact, it’s the start of a beautiful mathematical story at the heart of modern group theory, geometry, logic and analysis. I’ll try to tell some of that story.<br>

<li>Dr N. M. Vriend, “Using mathematics in my journey to deserts and mountains”.<br>
Abstract: In this presentation, I will show you how applied mathematics plays an important role in the understanding of our natural environment. My research expertise covers granular materials and I have traveled to various places on this earth to investigate the behavior of snow avalanches in mountains and sand dunes in deserts. Our research group combines field experiments with laboratory experiments, in the GK Batchelor laboratory underneath the courtyard of CMS, and uses mathematical tools to model these observations. Our goal is to understand the dynamic behavior of granular flows and potentially even predict some outcomes of avalanches.</li>
<li>Ms M. D. Fortune, “All About That Bayes: Making Inference from Data”.<br>
Abstract: As you go through life, you reinterpret your beliefs about the world based on what you observe. When you perform a scientific experiment, you want to update your conclusions about the underlying system based upon the results. But how can we do this rigorously? Bayes theorem is a simple equation; you probably encountered it in high school. But it is also the foundation for an entire field of statistical inference. I will reintroduce the theorem, and discuss some applications.</li>

<li>Ms C. Kirchhoff-Lukat, “Generalised Geometry: Double the Fun”.<br>
Abstract: I will give an introduction to Generalised Geometry: This fairly new extension of differential geometry allows us to generalise and unify different structures on smooth and complex manifolds. String theory is a primary motivation for the study of generalised metrics; using these, it is possible to describe massless string states in terms of a single geometric object. Delving further into the theory, we find a structure that encompasses the concepts of Poisson, symplectic and complex geometry. In my talk, I hope to give an impression of this wealth of possibilities which generalised geometry offers to both mathematics and theoretical physics.</li>
<li>Dr J. Nelson, “Statistical modelling in tennis: a case study using world rankings”.<br>
Abstract: In recent years, statistical modelling has played an increasingly important role in the sports industry – from player evaluation systems and tactical decision tools used by team managers (as popularised by films such as Moneyball) to predictive models deployed by bookmakers and gamblers to forecast future results. In this talk I will demonstrate that simple statistical methods – combined with a healthy dose of pragmatism – can generate surprisingly powerful models for predicting tennis… and explain how a pure mathematician came to be working on them.</li>

Abstract: Suppose you want to check some propositions P_1, P_2, P_3, … about a class C of mathematical objects. In this situation, a universal instance is an object A in the class C such that, for each n, P_n is true for A if and only if P_n is true for every object in the class C. Universal instances do not exist in general, but sometimes we can find exceptionally nice universal instances where it becomes much easier to check the propositions of interest. I will give some simple examples of this phenomenon, and time permitting, I may discuss general results.</li>

Abstract: General relativity is a theory of gravity described by the celebrated Einstein equations, which relate the geometry and matter content of spacetime. The Minkowski spacetime, the spacetime of special relativity, is a special solution to these equations. It depicts a vacuum spacetime with no curvature. A monumental result in mathematical physics, discovered in 1993, is the proof that Minkowski spacetime is dynamically stable in the framework of the evolution problem in general relativity. I will describe the theorem and some of the fascinating ideas behind it.<br>

Abstract: Algebraic geometry is the study of solution sets to polynomial equations. Usually, one is interested in solving equations over algebraically closed fields such as the complex numbers, but these solutions sets can be quite hard to visualize. However, a recently discovered type of geometry, which is called “tropical geometry” for rather silly reasons, helps us visualize these solution sets and at the same time solve rather difficult problems in algebraic geometry via purely combinatorial arguments. I will give an introduction to some of the basic ideas of the subject.<br>

The set of real numbers which badly approximable by rationals is an important example of such a set. In this talk, we will discuss Schmidt’s games, their applications and generalisations in geometry and dynamics.<br>

Abstract: Deformations of cell sheets are ubiquitous in early animal development, often arising from a complex and poorly understood interplay of cell shape changes, division, and migration. In this talk I will describe an approach to understanding such problems based on perhaps the simplest example of cell sheet folding: the “inversion” process of the algal genus Volvox, during which spherical embryos literally turn themselves inside out through a process hypothesized to arise from cell shape changes alone. Through a combination of light sheet microscopy and elasticity theory a quantitative understanding of this process is now emerging.<br>

<li>2 February 2016: Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Zagier">D. B. Zagier</a>, “Sums of squares and sums of cubes”.<br>
Abstract: Prof. Zagier finished high school aged 13 and subsequently studied at MIT for three years, completing his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the age of 16. He then received his Phd under Friedrich Hirzebruch aged 20 and was named professor when he was 24. He has been a scientific member of the MPIM in Bonn since its founding and has been one of its directors since 1995. Prof. Zagier’s main area of work is in number theory, but he has also done extensive work in seemingly unrelated areas. In collaboration with Benedict Gross he proved the Gross-Zagier formula which played an instrumental role in the solution of the Class Number Problem. He has also done work relating modular forms to string theory and black holes. Together with his former doctoral student Maxim Kontsevich he introduced the notion of ‘periods’ in a paper which features, among other things, L-functions and motives. He is perhaps best known for his “one-sentence proof of Fermat’s two squares theorem”. He is the winner of both the Cole Prize and the Von Staudt Prize.<br>

Abstract: It is often said that we know very little about Euclid. But we do have (most of) his Elements – perhaps the most widely studied secular book of all time. I claim that it is the expression of a remarkable mathematical personality. There are two distinct proofs of Pythagoras’ Theorem in Euclid’s Elements. I believe that we can reconstruct Euclid’s thinking in giving these two proofs. When we do so, we see what is an unrecognised depth to Euclid: not only was he a remarkable geometer and arithmetician but he also had the instincts of a modern logician.<br>

<li>Ms A. J. Thompson, “Tissue Mechanics in Early Brain Development”.<br>
Abstract: Neuronal growth is essential for nervous system development and is also required for regeneration after nervous tissue injury. Recent in vitro studies suggest that neuronal growth can also be regulated by mechanical properties of the substrate; however, the role of mechanical cues in axon pathfinding in vivo, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of tissue mechanics during early nervous system development, are still largely unknown. I am investigating the role of tissue stiffness in axon guidance within the early embryo, using the Xenopus laevis optic tract as a model system. I find that the path of optic tract growth is correlated with stiffness gradients in the living brain, before growth stalls after reaching the softer region. This is consistent with a role for substrate mechanics in axon pathfinding.</li>

Well, worry no more! With a few simple statistical fallacies, you can quickly produce significant results, and even the most disappointing dataset can become a published paper.</li>
<li>Dr J. Nelson, “Smashing the Racket: Detecting Match-fixing in Tennis via In-play Betting Irregularities”.<br>
Abstract: An unfortunate consequence of the recent growth in tennis betting markets has been a heightened incentive for match-fixing – particularly at lower levels of the sport, where earnings are modest, and where the market for one match may dwarf the prize money for an entire tournament. Against this backdrop, an unscrupulous player may be tempted to profit from their position of influence by secretly agreeing to “throw” a particular match, with a complicit third party betting on the result. This talk summarises the results of a match-fixing study spanning over 5,000 in-play tennis betting markets. After developing a natural point-by-point probabilistic model, featuring novel mechanisms for selecting parameters robustly from the data, we demonstrate that the observed market trajectories correlate extremely closely with this model. We argue that substantial discrepancies represent a “red flag” that something is amiss – either an injury, or something more covert. We also provide visualisations of recent matches where the market evolved pathologically, and assess the evidence that these matches were fixed.</li>
<li>Mr J. Pichon-Pharabod, “Semantics”.<br>
Abstract: Programs never do what you want them to do. To figure out what a program means, if you are lucky, you just have to wade through long, tedious, imprecise, and ambiguous prose documents. If you’re unlucky, the meaning is left as an exercise to the reader. In this talk, I will discuss how to formally give meaning to programs using elementary mathematics: sets, functions, and inductive relations. I will show how this makes it possible to actually make sure programs do what we want them to do.</li>

<li>Mr P. Short, “Mutations in Developmental Disorders”.<br>
Abstract: The majority of children with severe developmental disorders remain without a genetic diagnosis. Families often describe the road to reaching a diagnosis as an ‘odyssey’ lasting years and involving dozens of different medical professionals. The Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study has collected detailed clinical phenotypes and genome sequence data from 14,000 children with undiagnosed developmental disorders and their parents as an effort to quickly and definitively reach a genetic diagnosis. Using data from the first 4,000 DDD patients, my computational analyses have already generated hypotheses relating to specific variants in individual genomic functional elements. This work will contribute to an improved understanding of the role of the regulatory genome in developmental disorders and provides a scalable model for the interpretation of non-coding elements in rare disease cohorts.</li>

Abstract: Felix Klein classified the finite subgroups of SL(2,CC) around 1860; there are two infinite families corresponding to regular polygons in the plane, together with three exceptional groups of order 24, 48 and 120 that are “spinor” double covers of the symmetry groups of the regular polyhedra (the tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron). The finite subgroups of SL(3,CC) are also classified (and also SL(n,CC) for higher n), although the problem gets harder and it is not clear how to view the assortment of solutions with any pretence to elegance. The quotient spaces X = CC^2/G by Klein’s finite subgroups G in SL(2,CC) form a very remarkable family of isolated surface singularities, that were studied by Du Val during the 1930s (aided by Coxeter). Du Val’s work was central to the study of algebraic surfaces during the 1970s and 1980s, and played a foundational role in the study of algebraic 3-folds from the 1980s onwards. In the 1980s McKay observed that the representation theory of the group G is reflected in the geometry of the resolution of singularities of X. This correspondence has been generalised to 3-dimensions, with the same proviso concerning the nature of the problem and its solutions.</li>

Abstract: This talk will explain why string theory is such a compelling approach to understanding the fundamental particles and the physical forces, even though it is not yet a complete theory and it has yet to make precise experimental predictions. It will give an overview of the theory, illustrating how it describes physics at ultra-short distances in a manner that is radically different from more conventional theories. I will illustrate how the structure of string theory is influencing our understanding of quantum gravity as well as having profound connections with aspects of modern mathematics. The talk will end with an overview of recent ideas, which suggest that the string theory may have applications in areas of physics far removed from the ones it was originally intended for.<br>

Abstract: Many types of cell in our bodies are not static but actively move around. The effects can be good, such as when immune cells search and destroy invading organisms, or bad, such as when cancer cells spread to distant parts of the body. Many biochemical circuits are implicated in cell movement, but cell fragments with no such circuits also move spontaneously — the cellular equivalent of a headless chicken. This observation suggests the presence of an autonomous “motility engine” whose operation is controlled, but not maintained, by the complex biochemical circuits present in real cells. I shall describe a simplified mathematical model for this engine, using ideas borrowed from the study of liquid crystalline materials, as found in every mobile phone and laptop screen.<br>

As an example of the advantages of thinking coalgebraically, I will talk about the enrichment of the category of algebras over coalgebras, and specifically the consequent benefits afforded to the concept of “maps between modules”.<br>

<li>21 November 2016: Dr S. P. Bursill-Hall and Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Forster_(mathematician)">T. E. Forster</a>, “Infinitesimals”.<br>
Abstract: Think of infinitesimals as the mathematical equivalent of fat, sugar, and salt. They are evil, bad for your health, bad for the environment, bad for society, racist, sexist, ageist, class-ist (does that even exist?), cause cancer, lumbago, scrofulous, melancholy, quantum mechanics, and premature ageing. In any reasonable mathematical universe, they would be banned. The ancient Greeks knew how unhealthy they were, and banned them, thoroughly and soundly. Yet they kept coming back in western, European mathematics, and they proved to be something mathematicians couldn’t resist – sort of like Nutella. And for all that everyone knew they were completely and irredeemably paradoxical, they were essential to large parts of geometry, and by the Scientific Revolution they formed the foundation stone of contemporary, cutting edge new pure and applied mathematics. In the Enlightenment the house of cards started to collapse, threatening all of civilisation. They were finally, permanently expunged from mathematics in the earlier 19th century, never to return. A huge sigh of relief all around. Except … In the second half Dr Forster will sketch a couple of ways in which the twentieth century has been able to put infinitesimals on a secure footing.<br>

<li>23 January 2017: Dr T. von Glehn, “Logic in other universes”.<br>
Abstract: When doing ordinary mathematics, we don’t usually think too hard about exactly what logical rules are being used. But sometimes using for example the law of excluded middle or the axiom of choice can have unexpected consequences. In this talk I will explore some alternatives of classical logic. There are other ‘mathematical universes’, or toposes, in which different logical axioms can hold. I will introduce some of the structures used to express this logic, and describe what mathematics can look like inside a topos.<br>

<li>30 January 2017: Prof. J. R. Lister, “Stretching, bending, twisting and coiling: how to build a fluid-mechanical sewing machine”.<br>
Abstract: Idlers at breakfast watching a stream of honey falling from a knife, may notice it buckle and coil as it reaches the toast. What happens if you move the toast (or the knife) steadily sideways? This talk will outline the mathematical description of the dynamics of a falling viscous thread, with possible diversions via chocolate fountains and Viennetta ice-cream.<br>

<li>6 February 2017: Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gog">J. R. Gog</a>, “Hunting for viral packaging signals”.<br>
Abstract: Influenza has a genome split into several segments, and this complicates virus particle assembly as each particle must have one of each of the segments. This means that each of the RNA segments must contain some signal, and that this signal ought to be fairly conserved. Is this enough to go and hunt them down using mathematics? The answer turns out to be yes. However, this required some creativity in algorithm design, drawing inspiration from a number of apparently unrelated problems. This hack seems to work, but leaves some interesting mathematical problems. I’ll also briefly talk about some of the other problems in influenza and infectious disease that interest me, and general joys and challenges of being a mathematician trying to research biology.<br>

Abstract: Consider a simple random walk on a finite network. The expected time it takes for a single walk to visit all nodes is a well-studied quantity and has been computed for many topologies including paths, grids, random graphs and hypercubes. But how long does it take for two or more independently running random walks? This talk will explain why this may be an interesting question and present a few surprising results.<br>

<li>16 February 2017: Dr S. Dieleman, “Deep learning for music recommendation and generation”.<br>
Abstract: The advent of deep learning has made it possible to extract high-level information from perceptual signals without having to specify manually and explicitly how to obtain it; instead, this can be learned from examples. This creates opportunities for automated content analysis of musical audio signals. In this talk, I will discuss how deep learning techniques can be used for audio-based music recommendation. I will also briefly discuss my ongoing work on music generation with WaveNet.<br>

<li>20 February 2017: Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Pedley">T. J. Pedley</a>, “Spherical squirmers—models for swimming micro-organisms: how a Tripos question led to a new field of research”.<br>
Abstract: In 1952, Sir James Lighthill (FT) introduced the simplest possible model of a swimming microorganism of finite size, intended as a model of a single-celled protozoan covered in beating cilia. The model consisted of a sphere, on the surface of which material points undergo small-amplitude oscillations. In 1971, Lighthill’s student, John Blake (FT), completed the calculations and in particular showed how to model the ‘metachronal’ wave patterns exhibited by beating cilia. In 1986 the speaker set a Part II Tripos question, to analyse an even simpler model consisting of a sphere whose surface moves tangentially with time-independent velocity: a steady spherical squirmer. This has led to a substantial body of research on the optimisation pf the swimming and nutrient uptake of individual squirmers (Eric Lauga, FT), and on the hydrodynamic interactions between pairs of steady squirmers and their influence on self-diffusion in suspensions. The final topic describes measurements and modelling of metachronal waves in Volvox, the only truly spherical multicelled ‘organism’, culminating in the prediction of the mean swimming speed and angular velocity of free-swimming Volvox. The predictions are compared with experimental observations. [FT ≡ Fellow of Trinity]<br>

<li>Dr H. Hunt, “The Trinity College Clock, its accuracy and its pigeons”.<br>
Abstract: The Trinity Clock in Great Court is quite a prominent feature of the college, at least to look at. And it has a rather curious way of announcing the hours, once for Trinity and a second time for St John’s. It is always within a second or two of the correct time and yet it hardly ever requires adjustment. Does this mean that the mechanism is unaffected by the elements? What about temperature, pressure, humidity? And does the gravitational pull of the moon make any difference? The pendulum on the Trinity Clock has been instrumented to measure period and amplitude to great accuracy. The time is compared with UTC obtained from a GPS receiver. All of this data is streamed continuously to the web at http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/. The clock has become quite a sensitive pigeon detector!</li>
<li>Mr S. O. Tickle, “Dr Changelove (or how I learned to stop worrying and realise everything is a changepoint problem)”.<br>
Abstract: You don’t have to go further than Paul McCartney to find that it is, in fact, a changing world in which we live in. Due to recent efforts, particularly at Cambridge and Lancaster, understanding with respect to the changepoint problem is at a much more tolerable state from the perspective of the researcher. However, several key questions remain. How does one efficiently deal with multivariate data? Can new methodologies keep pace with the ever growing demands of industry? And, perhaps most importantly, why, no matter how hard we might shut our eyes to it, is everything a changepoint problem?</li>
<li>Mr C. Riccio, “The genetic and transcriptional diversity of C. elegans wild isolates”.<br>
Abstract: In 1963, Sydney Brenner, who spent 20 years of his career in Cambridge, established Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism in biology. It is in C. elegans that many apoptotic genes were discovered. Later on, homologous genes in humans were found to also be involved in apoptosis. The work of Nobel Prize winners Andrew Fire and Craig Mello on RNA interference has also been conducted in this animal. Most of the work in C. elegans has been conducted in a strain isolated in Bristol many decades ago. Until recently, little was known about the natural habitat of this nematode and its genetic and phenotypic diversity. In this talk, I will present how we can use the natural genetic and phenotypic diversity of this animal to study the relationship between its phenotype and its genotype.</li>
<li>Mr S. K. Moss, “Homotopy Type Theory”.<br>
Abstract: I will give an introduction to Homotopy Type Theory, which is a formal foundational system where the basic objects are spaces rather than sets and every function that one can define is automatically continuous. Among its advantages is that it provides a ‘synthetic’ version of homotopy theory convenient for computer-formalized proofs.</li>
<li>Dr B. Narayanan, “Symmetric structures in extremal combinatorics”.</li>
<li>Mr J. Munro, “Paradoxes in Fluid Dynamics”.<br>
Abstract: Applied mathematics tries to explain the world around us with mathematical models, but what do you do if the answer from your model just doesn’t make any sense? I’ll describe two paradoxes that plagued fluid dynamics for hundreds of years, explain what we learnt from their resolution, and show you how this new understanding is being applied to current research problems.</li>
<li>Mr J. Sahasrabudhe, “Exponential Patterns in Arithmetic Ramsey Theory”.<br>
Abstract: If the integers are partitioned into finitely many pieces, what can be said about the arithmetic structure of the parts? Indeed, it is perhaps remarkable that anything interesting can be said about such general partitions. One of the first results along these lines was proved over 100 years ago by I. Schur, who proved that if the positive integers are partitioned into finitely many parts, then one of the parts must contain two integers x,y and their sum x+y. In this talk I’ll discuss a host of new results about exponential patterns that can be found in arbitrary finite partitions of the integers.</li>
<li>Mr R. Snyder, “Finding structure in graph theory using high minimum degree”.<br>
Abstract: If H is a collection of graphs, we say that a graph G is H-free if it contains no copy of a graph in H as a subgraph. Many problems in extremal graph theory involve investigating the behaviour of various graph parameters, or determining the structure of H-free graphs for specific families H. It turns out that we can say quite a few fascinating things about the structure of graphs which forbid some finite collection of subgraphs and, in addition, have large minimum degree. In this talk I shall describe several results of this type, both old and new, and hopefully convey why they are interesting.</li>
<li>Mr V. Gruslys, “Tilings of ℤ^n”.<br>
Abstract: Let T be a finite subset of ℤ^2. We can view T as a tile consisting of |T| unit squares. Must it be possible to cover the plane by non-overlapping copies of T? (We allow translations, rotations and reflections of T.) The answer is, of course, no: just take a tile with a hole. However, if we replace every unit square of T by a unit cube, then we get a 3-dimensional analogue of T. We now ask: does T tile ℤ^3? Or, does T tile ℤ^n for some, possibly very large, n? We prove that the answer to the latter question is yes, confirming a conjecture of Chalcraft. This talk is based on joint work with Leader and Tan.</li>
<li>Mr B. J. Barrett, “Group theory and highly connected networks”.<br>
Abstract: A well-designed computer network should allow quick and reliable communication between any two computers while keeping the number of computers any single computer is directly connected to small. Such networks are called expanders. The first construction of such networks due to was based on a deep property of certain groups, called Property T. In this talk I will define expanders and describe their links with group theory.</li>
<li>Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_Dru%C8%9Bu">C. Druțu</a>, “Geometric Group Theory”.<br>
Abstract: In a way, this academic year has been a Geometric Group Theory year, with a large scale research programme held from August to December 2016 at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, followed by a programme from January to June 2017 at the Newton Institute in Cambridge. These events have been particularly timely, as the area recorded a series of recent breakthrough results, ranging from the work of Ian Agol (who answers the remaining four of Thurston’s conjectures on the structure of 3-manifolds), to the work of Cheeger, Kleiner, Naor and Young (solving the Sparsest Cut Problem, and the related Goemans-Linial conjecture, in Theoretical computer science). So, what is Geometric Group Theory? In my talk I will try to overview this area, and convey its general philosophy of reformulating in geometric terms problems from diverse areas of mathematics and then solving them with a variety of tools.</li>

Abstract: Haskell is my first baby, born slightly before my son Michael, who is now in his mid-20s. From somewhat academic beginnings as a remorselessly pure functional programming language, Haskell has evolved into a practical tool used for real applications and, amazingly, is still in a state of furious innovation. In this talk I’ll discuss Haskell’s birth and evolution, including some of the research and engineering challenges we faced in design and implementation. I’ll focus particularly on the ideas that have turned out, in retrospect, to be most important and influential, as well as sketching some current developments and making some wild guesses about the future. It has been a long journey, but it starts at Trinity College, where I was a maths undergraduate, and Arthur Norman first introduced me to the joy and beauty of functional programming.<br>

<li>16 October 2017: Dr A. Zsák, “Embedding Structures with Distortion”.<br>
Abstract: There is a wide variety of structures that are equipped with a distance. A familiar example is three-dimensional Euclidean space: here the distance is the length of the straight line segment joining two points. In this example there is an additional feature: the presence of vector addition and scalar multiplication. There are examples, however, that do not possess such additional features, and it is an important question to determine whether such arbitrary structures can be embedded into ones with a vector structure like Euclidean space. This has consequences for large data, algorithms, compressed sensing, etc., some of which have emerged in unexpected and surprising ways.<br>

Abstract: A call option is a basic example of a financial derivative. Black, Scholes and Merton published in 1973 a theory for ‘rational pricing’ of call options, for which the Nobel Prize was awarded in 1997. This talk will briefly explain this theory, and discuss how the pricing of call options has some interesting mathematical properties – touching on probability, convex analysis and even algebra.<br>

Abstract: A tree is a graph without any cycles. Since there are only a finite number of trees with n vertices, one can imagine picking such a tree at random just like one can pick a card from a deck at random. It turns out that random trees have many applications and are ubiquitous in modern probability theory. In this talk, I will describe some of the basics of random trees and how they are related to some very exciting recent mathematical developments.<br>

Abstract: Mathematics is central to our understanding of the world around us. We live in a vast dynamical system, the many dimensions of which can be interrogated with mathematical tools. In this talk I will consider our changing climate. I will describe the scientific evidence that tells us how and why our climate is changing, and what the future may hold. In this journey I will pause at various waypoints to describe in more detail some of the insight different branches of mathematics are providing. Diverse examples will include applying ideas from dynamical systems research to create novel strategies for measuring the ocean mixing processes that are critical to the flow of heat and carbon through the Earth system, through to employing statistical learning techniques to improve future predictions of Arctic sea ice, currently in perilous decline. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Responding to the challenge requires robust scientific evidence to inform policies. Opportunities for mathematicians to contribute to this important issue abound.<br>

<li>22 January 2018: Dr S. K. Andres, “Loop Erased Random, Uniform Spanning Trees and Percolation”.<br>
Abstract: In graph theory spanning trees have been investigated already since the 19th century. They appear for instance as objects in a number of algorithms. On the other hand, in modern probability theory certain random spanning trees, so called uniform spanning trees, have had a fruitful history. Most notably, around the turn of the millennium the study of these spanning trees led Oded Schramm to introduce the SLE process, work which has revolutionised the study of two dimensional models in statistical physics. One reason for the importance of uniform spanning trees is their intimate relation to another model, the loop-erased random walks. In this talk we will introduce both models and explain their connection by means of Wilson’s algorithm. In the last part we will discuss some relations to percolation theory.<br>

We’ll take a mathematical walk around the Mandelbrot set, visiting the minibrots and the Feigenbaum point. We’ll stop at the rabbit, corabbit, and airplane, and answer the question: what happens when you twist the ears of the rabbit? We’ll find the freshman sum and the Fibonacci sequence. Finally, we’ll provide one answer to the question every mathematician wonders when they first meet the Mandelbrot set: why do we care about this pretty picture?<br>

Abstract: The classic problem of finding shortest paths in a directed graph can be generalised to finding paths taking path weights in a large class of semirings. This approach has been developed over the last fifty years, with many interesting applications. However, if we try to model some existing Internet routing protocols using semirings we see that the distributivity law [a(b + c) = ab + ac] is often violated. Since distributivity is vital in semiring theory, we are forced to explore what, if anything, can be accomplished with such “impoverished” algebraic structures.<br>

Abstract: Symplectic geometry provides the framework for classical mechanics, but it is also a rapidly evolving major area of modern pure mathematics. I will give a brief introduction to symplectic structures, and then discuss a fundamental property of symplectomorphisms, maps which preserve the symplectic structure. Gromov’s non-squeezing theorem is one of the first major results about such maps, answering the question why a symplectic camel cannot pass through the eye of a needle: Its ribcage cannot be symplectically compressed! Finally, I will touch on quantum mechanics and how the non-squeezing property manifests itself there in the form of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation.</li>
<li>Mr M. Leonhardt, “CFT of IQNF via EC with CM”.<br>
Abstract: In this talk, we will go on a journey through the realm of algebraic number theory. We will talk a little bit about Galois theory before moving on to class field theory (CFT). The goal of class field theory is to describe all abelian extensions of a given number field. We will first do this for the field of rational numbers, using roots of unity. Then we will give an introduction to elliptic curves (EC) and the theory of complex multiplication (CM). This allows us in the end to describe all abelian extensions of a given imaginary quadratic number field (IQNF).</li>
<li>Ms V. Siska, “A metapopulation model of the spread of the Devil Facial Tumour Disease predicts the long term collapse of its host but not its extinction”.<br>
Abstract: The Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), a unique case of a transmissible cancer, had a devastating effect on the Tasmanian Devils, leading to an overall population decline of over 80%. A number of single-population epidemiological models have predicted the likely extinction of the Tasmanian Devils. However, despite extensive surveys across Tasmania providing data on the spatial and temporal spread of DFTD, the metapopulation dynamics of this disease has yet to be modelled. Here we fit a stochastic spatial metapopulation model of the origin and spread of the DFTD to empirical observations of local disease trajectories and time-stamped observations of diseased animals across Tasmania, using the Approximate Bayesian Computation statistical method to account for the randomness of the population dynamics and spread of the disease. We confirm a most likely origin of the disease in the north-east corner of the island, and highlight the importance of interpopulation contacts in the fast spread of the tumour. We then use the inferred metapopulation dynamics to predict the fate of this host-pathogen system. Surprisingly, we find that the devils are predicted to coexist with the tumour, in contrast with predictions from single population models. The key process allowing long-term persistence of the species is the repeated reinvasion of extinct patches from neighbouring areas where the disease has flared up and died out, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium with different levels of spatial heterogeneity. However, this dynamic equilibrium is predicted to keep the population of this apex predator at roughy 10% of its original density, with possible dramatic effects on the Tasmanian ecosystem.</li>
<li>Ms K. Wyczesany, “Surprising phenomena of high-dimensional convex bodies”.<br>
Abstract: How well can you imagine high-dimensional objects? What can you say about the behaviour of convex bodies in n-dimensional space as n grows to infinity? During the talk I will try to convince you that our intuition based on low dimensional geometry can be far off and that unexpected phenomena occur. For example, we will see that the mass of a high dimensional ball is concentrated on a thin band around any equator. This result plays an important role in many theorems in asymptotic geometric analysis, such as Dvoretzky’s theorem, which suggests that all convex bodies admit “almost ellipsoidal” sections. We will make this statement precise.</li>
<li>Mr P. Velickovic, “Towards practical convolutional neural networks on graphs”.<br>
Abstract: A multitude of important real-world datasets come together with some form of graph structure: social networks, citation networks, protein-protein interactions, brain connectome data, etc. Extending neural networks to be able to properly deal with this kind of data is, therefore, a very important direction for machine learning research, but one that has received comparatively rather low levels of attention until very recently. Unlike the structure that one might typically find in an image or text, the graph structure is often highly irregular, and producing a general operator (such as a convolution for images or a recurrent cell for text) that satisfies all the criteria we would like for an operator like this is known to be very difficult. Several approaches that have been recently proposed (a lot of them only in 2017!) attempt to handle the problem from a variety of perspectives: structural, stochastic and/or spectral. In this talk I will give a comprehensive overview of these approaches, outlining their relative strengths and limitations, and exposing some cool application areas where they’ve been applied. Special emphasis will be given to the work I’ve done in collaboration with Adriana Romero and Yoshua Bengio (Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms), on Graph Attention Networks (GATs: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903), which might offer the first neural network layer to satisfy all of the desirable criteria simultaneously.</li>
<li>Dr A. Beskos, “Exact Solution on Non-Linear Stochastic Differential Equations”.<br>
Abstract: Non-linear (Ordinary) Differential Equations (ODEs) are typically impossible to solve analytically – instead one has to refer to one of the many available *approximate* methods (accompanied by an enormous amount of research on the characterisation of their convergence properties) to numerically represent the ODE and develop an understanding of its behavior. A similar scenario arises in the context of *Stochastic* Differential Equations (SDEs). However, it appears that the presence of randomness allows for much more flexibility compared to the deterministic case. We describe a recent, surprisingly simple algorithm, that solves non-linear SDEs without any approximation error. We stress that exact solution of SDEs is a notorious problem within the applied probability community, and the talk will present a direction toward the solution of this problem.</li>
<li>Prof. R. Cont, “Taming roughness—the calculus of irregular functions”.<br>
Abstract: Newton’s differential calculus provides a framework for studying smooth transformations of smooth functions. Many quantities of important in physics, engineering and economics follow an irregular time evolution, leading to irregular and non-differentiable signals whose (ir)regularity may be described by the notion of p-th order variation along a refining sequence of time partitions. We will show that smooth transformations of such irregular functions obey a higher-order version of Newton’s calculus. In the case p=2, one retrieves the Ito formula from stochastic calculus, but without any probabilistic assumptions.</li>

Abstract: (The following abstract was for the originally announced title, “A Simple Proof of a Major Result”.) The solutions of highly rated problems that have remained unsolved for decades tend to be long and complicated. Although this is what we have come to expect, this is not always the case: occasionally a novel approach leads to a remarkably short and beautiful solution. In my talk I shall give a particularly striking example of a simple solution of a notoriously difficult problem emerging out of the blue.<br>

Abstract: Stein’s paradox is one of the most striking results in Statistics. Although it appears to be a toy problem in mathematical statistics, it turns out to have profound implications for the analysis of modern, high-dimensional data. I will describe both the result and some of its consequences.<br>

<li>12 November 2018: Dr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arieh_Iserles">A. Iserles</a>, “Approximation on the Real Line”.<br>
Abstract: The purpose of the exercise is simple, to design an orthogonal basis in the space of square-integrable functions on the real line such that the linear map taking the basis to its derivatives is skew symmetric. Such bases possess numerous advantages in the computation of ODEs and PDEs. In this talk, based on a joint work with Marcus Webb, I will completely characterise all such orthogonal systems using Fourier analysis and the theory of orthogonal polynomials. The extension of this work to complex-valued skew-Hermitian ‘differentiation matrices’ is trivial but it leads to a beautiful outcome, an orthogonal system of rational functions designed (in a different context) almost a century ago by Malmquist and Takenaka and which exhibits some truly miraculous properties.<br>

Abstract: It is an experimental fact that when an extended system in a simple amorphous state becomes unstable, the new realised state is typically one exhibiting a pattern. It can be shown even for very complicated physical systems that the dynamical processes near the point in parameter space where stability is lost can be represented by a small number of ordinary differential equations. The form of these equations, and the interactions of any possible patterns that can result from the instability, is strongly influenced, and in many cases determined, by the symmetries of the system being studied. One the symmetry group is known, the different patterns can be identified with different representations of the group. I will discuss a number of examples of varying complexity.<br>

Abstract: A polynomial that is a sum of squares of other polynomials can only take nonnegative values. This trivial observation is surprisingly powerful: many inequalities in mathematics have simple sum-of-squares proofs. I will discuss algorithms that can automatically search for sum-of-squares proofs for polynomial inequalities, and the extent to which they can be considered as “automatic proof machines”.<br>

Abstract: What was the state of mathematics – and particularly the foundations of mathematics – when Russell came up to Cambridge, and what would have driven him to the project of the Principia Mathematica … one of the most extraordinary and important failures of 20th century mathematics.</li>
<li>Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Reid">M. A. Reid</a>, “Trinity Around 1970 – student life and math activities”.<br>
Abstract: The talk will consist mainly of self-indulgent recollections of student life in Trinity 1966–1972, including a few anecdotes about Peter Swinnerton-Dyer and some of the many other great characters who were around, and with a few brief sections on math studies.</li>
<li>Prof. C. A. Tout, “Milne and the Dawn of the Theory of Stellar Structure”.<br>
Abstract: Between 1921 and 1937 Edward Arthur Milne published around 90 papers on stars. This was a period of very rapid change in our understanding of these fascinating objects that make up the visible Universe and Milne was a key player in these changes. In 1925 Cecilia Payne found the first indications that hydrogen is the major constituent of the Sun. Though Eddington was already convinced that nuclear fusion is the source of a star’s luminosity it was not until 1928 that Gamow applied quantum mechanical tunnelling to alpha particle emission and it became feasible that fusion could operate at the temperatures expected at the centres of stars. Milne’s early contributions concerned stellar atmospheres, including the formation of spectral lines and limb darkening. Later he delved into many aspects of stellar structure, including rotating stars, pulsating stars, binary stars and collapsed degenerate stars. It was Milne’s work on collapsed stars that caught the attention of Chandrasekhar and led him to determine the maximum mass for a white dwarf in 1931. I shall endeavour to portray these exciting times and how the ideas have developed into our present-day theory of stellar structure and evolution.</li>
<li>Dr R. G. E. Pinch, “From CATAM to Quantum”.<br>
Abstract: I plan to explore how mathematics, both pure and applied, has interacted with computation from the 1970s to the present day. I’ll illustrate with some of my own experiences from student days through to advising government on post-quantum cryptography, and how my research related to (but did not solve) three of the notorious Clay Millennium Problems.</li>
<li>Mr R. Chapling, “G.H. Hardy: The leading mathematician in England”.<br>

Abstract: The talk will be in two parts, one about undergraduate life in Cambridge in the early 1940’s and the second about Frank Anscombe and the Statistical Laboratory in the early 1950’s.</li>
<li>Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gog">J. R. Gog</a>, “Mathematical biology: the trickiest branch of mathematics?”.<br>
Abstract: Mathematical Biology certainly would not have made sense to the members of TMS as a research field 100 years ago. Now, most decent maths degree include a course on it, and Math Bio continues to grow as a research field. Aside from a bit of wild speculation and generalising, I will focus on the bits of Math Bio that I know: the dynamics of infectious disease. I will introduce some recent work, and some thoughts on the potential for this area in future.</li>
<li>Prof. C. P. Caulfield, “How the Titanic Tragedy transformed Trinity: Turbulence Theory and Taylor in the Teens”.<br>
Abstract: George Ingram Taylor (Trinity undergraduate 1905–1908; elected fellow 1910) was one of the most influential applied mathematicians of the 20th century, who made a huge number of contributions to fluid and solid mechanics. This talk will focus on the significance, for both Cambridge Mathematics and the world at large, of the work presented in his Adams Prize Essay of 1915 on “Turbulent Motion in Fluids”. Some of the key results presented in this essay, the partial manuscript of which is held in the Trinity Library, rely on data taken by Taylor himself on the first “Ice Patrol” cruise, triggered by the tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic. The essay was actually written when Taylor was participating in the first world war effort designing aircraft at Farnborough for the precursor of the Royal Air Force, and the talk will also consider the lasting influence on applied mathematics of Taylor’s philosophical approach to research.</li>
<li>Dr F. G. Woodhouse, “Mechanics meets biology”.<br>
Abstract: Unlike an ordinary gas, biological systems are never in equilibrium: cells constantly use chemical energy to grow and move, forming a clear arrow of time. The recent creation of artificial versions of these ‘active’ systems raises the tantalising prospect of soft robotic systems fuelled by as simple a source as oxygen. After a tour through the mathematics of elastic networks, marrying linear algebra, graph theory and dynamics and invoking plenty of tenuous Trinity connections, we will see how endowing such a network with biologically-inspired activity can create intricate self-actuating mechanisms.</li>

<li>Dr M. D. Fortune, “Designing Dementia Trials Embedded Within a Cohort”.<br>
Abstract: Clinical trial recruitment sounds like it should be a job for the medics, not the mathematicians. But what if you already have access to decades of data about your prospective participants, and want to select those who you wish to invite to take part based on mathematical predication of how their disease will progress? In many dementia trials, the focus is upon patients who are asymptomatic or at an early stage in the disease. We would like to choose trial participants who are likely to benefit from the treatment. However, if our recruitment is too selective, we may not be able to say anything about the effect of the treatment in the whole population. Any strategy needs to balance the pay-off between these two factors.</li>
<li>Mr O. Y. Feng, “Maximum likelihood estimation of a log-concave density”.<br>
Abstract: A density on R^d is said to be log-concave if its logarithm is a concave function, and the estimation of a unknown log-concave density based on i.i.d. observations represents a central problem in the area of non-parametric inference under shape constraints. In contrast to traditional smoothing techniques, the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator is a fully automatic estimator which does not require the choice of any tuning parameters and therefore has the potential to offer practitioners the best of the parametric and non-parametric worlds. I will discuss some recent theoretical results on the performance of this estimator, with a particular focus on its ability to adapt to structural features of the target density.</li>
<li>Dr C. P. Turner, “Introduction to Topological Phases of Matter”.<br>
Abstract: I will talk a little about how we traditionally classify states of matter, and then blow this out of the water by introducing the idea of a topological phase of matter. The idea is that even fairly innocuous interactions between particles can result in striking collective behaviours at low energies; this includes sensitivity to the topology of the surface that the system is built on, and emergent “anyonic” particle-like objects, exhibiting properties that are impossible for fundamental particles in our universe. These phases of matter have connections to many areas of ongoing research, from pure mathematical classification problems, through dreams of quantum computation and quantum error correction, to condensed matter experiments. I will try to give a brief overview of how all this arises through simple examples.</li>
<li>Mr K. P. Kalinin, “Networks of non-equilibrium condensates for global optimisation of spin Hamiltonians”.<br>
Abstract: The majority of optimisation problems are computationally impractical for conventional classical computers and known as NP-hard optimisation problems. Such problems deal with scheduling, the dynamic analysis of neural networks and financial markets, the prediction of new chemical materials, and machine learning. Incredibly, it is possible to reformulate these optimisation problems into the problem of finding the ground state of a particular spin Hamiltonian. In my talk I will address various physical platforms that can simulate such spin Hamiltonians in order to solve optimisation problems orders of magnitude faster than can be achieved on a classical computer. In particular, the spin Hamiltonians can be simulated experimentally with polariton condensates. These are effectively comprised of a “mix” of the states of light and matter, and can be explicitly mapped into problems such as the travelling salesman problem. Using such mappings, one can study physical systems experimentally and effectively “read out” the solution to an optimisation problem one wishes to solve. A possible speedup opens a path to global minimisation of large-scale, real-world problems not accessible by classical simulations.</li>
<li>Ms Y. I. Li, “The non-equilibrium characteristics of active matter”.<br>
Abstract: Active matter consists of a large number of “active” particles, each of which is capable of consuming energy locally, causing them to move with deterministic or stochastic rules that break the time reversal symmetry. Examples of active matter are commonplace in biology: bird flocks, bacteria colonies, tumour growth, self-organising bio-polymers etc. As a result of this constant injection and dissipation of energy at the microscopic level, these systems are permanently driven away from equilibrium, where many familiar principles of statistical physics don’t apply. Recent progresses have enabled us to capture the collective behaviours of many complex biological systems in terms of simpler models, making it easier to trace the non-equilibrium nature of such systems. Specifically, the talk will focus on self-propelled bacteria with quorum sensing and population dynamics.<br>

<li>Mr A. J. Chamolly, “Why sperm doesn’t have fins”.<br>
Abstract: Have you never wondered? Alright, I forgive you. But, if you somehow did produce sperm with fins you’d soon realise that it’s actually an existential question — literally — as with such equipment you’d never have come to be. Lacking inertia, the physics of fluids on the microscale is vastly different from our everyday experience, and so sperm, bacteria and other microswimmers had to develop unique strategies to survive. I will present some surprising theorems, highlight how nature has adapted in response to them and how they challenge current designs for artificial microrobots. Expect wet jokes and dry puns.</li>
<li>Dr M. C. Gomez, “Elastic snap-through: from the Venus flytrap to jumping popper toys”.<br>
Abstract: Snap-through buckling is a type of instability in which an elastic object rapidly jumps from one state to another. Such instabilities are familiar from everyday life: children’s popper toys rapidly ‘pop’ and jump after being turned inside-out, while snap-through is harnessed to generate fast motions in applications ranging from soft robotics to artificial heart valves. In biology, snap-through has long been exploited to convert energy stored slowly into explosive movements: both the leaf of the Venus flytrap and the beak of the hummingbird snap-through to catch prey unawares. Despite the ubiquity of snap-through in nature and engineering, its dynamics is usually only understood qualitatively, with many examples reported of delay phenomena in which snap-through occurs much more slowly than would be expected for an elastic instability. To explain this discrepancy, it is commonly assumed that some dissipation mechanism (such as material viscoelasticity) must be causing the system to lose energy and slow down. In this talk we examine how viscoelasticity influences the snap-through dynamics of a simple truss-like structure. We present a regime diagram that characterises when the timescale of snap-through is governed by viscous or elastic effects, and relate this to the creep behaviour we see in jumping popper toys.</li>
<li>Mr M. Leonhardt, “Why is e^π√163 almost an integer?”.<br>
Abstract: e^π√163=262537412640768743.99999999999925 is very close to an integer. Coincidence? Not at all. In this talk, we will see how this is related to the j-function, a certain holomorphic function on the upper half plane. We will interpret the j-function as a function on the space of elliptic curves, and then see how symmetries of elliptic curves and of this space have far-reaching consequences — not only for e^π√163.</li>
<li>Mr O. Janzer, “A generalization of the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers”.<br>
Abstract: The Ramsey number R(s,t) stands for the smallest positive integer N such that whenever the edges of the complete graph on N vertices are 2-coloured with red and blue, then there is a red clique on s vertices or a blue clique on t vertices. In this talk, I will review the known results about this function, mentioning some famous open problems. I will also talk about how random graphs can be used to prove lower bounds on R(s,t). Then I will present a generalisation of this function and state a recent result of Gowers and myself, which is based on an unusual random graph construction.</li>
<li>Mr A. J. Carlotti, “Uniform Bounds for Non-negativity of the Diffusion Game”.<br>
Abstract: I will discuss a variant of the chip-firing game known as the diffusion game. In the diffusion game, we begin with some integer labelling of the vertices of a graph, interpreted as a number of chips on each vertex, and then for each subsequent step every vertex simultaneously fires a chip to each neighbour with fewer chips. In general, this could result in negative vertex labels. In this talk I will answer the following question: do there exist values f(n), for each n, such that whenever we have a graph on n vertices and an initial allocation with at least f(n) chips on each vertex, then the number of chips on each vertex will remain non-negative. I will also consider the possibility of a similar bound g(d) for each d, where d is the maximum degree of the graph.</li>

Abstract: The sum-product conjecture, put forward by Erdős and Szemerédi in the 1980s, states that the set of all pairwise sums and the set of all pairwise products of a finite subset of the reals cannot simultaneously be close to minimal in size. Despite the simplicity of its statement and a significant amount of research effort devoted to its resolution, the conjecture remains open to this day. In this talk I will explain the motivation for the conjecture as well as some fascinating partial results.<br>

<li>4 March 2019: Prof. P. M. H. Wilson, “Elliptical billiards and Poncelet trajectories”.<br>
Abstract: Given an elliptical billiard table, to any ball trajectory which doesn’t cross the line segment joining the two foci, there is an associated smaller confocal ellipse inscribed in the trajectory. A Poncelet trajectory is one which is closed after a finite number of bounces. We’ll see that if there is one such closed trajectory with n segments, then starting from every point on the outer ellipse, there is a similar closed trajectory with n segments and the same inscribed ellipse, and indeed all these trajectories have the same length. Analogous geometric properties hold more generally for any pair of conics in the plane, and in modern terminology the existence of analogous Poncelet polygons is related to the torsion points on an associated elliptic curve.<br>

In this talk I will use research drawn from the world of physics and biology to convey what it means to be an applied mathematician.

Abstract: We are all taught that quantum mechanics suffers from lack of determinism. But classical, i.e. non-quantum, physics is supposedly deterministic: complete knowledge of initial conditions in the present uniquely determine the future. This notion of determinism is often associated with the name of Laplace, and finds a mathematical realisation in the standard existence and uniqueness theorems for differential equations. But is it really true that the classical equations of mathematical physics uphold this notion? This talk will explore one of the most spectacular ways that Laplacian determinism can in fact fail.<br>

Abstract: A paradox of our digital age is that while we can access the older literature more easily than ever before, all too often our focus is only on the latest postings to the arxiv. The purpose of this seminar is to illustrate, by means of a few key examples, the benefits than can come from reading the old literature. My goal here is to be mentorial, particularly toward younger scientists, to emphasise that the ability to ferret out the origins of ideas is an important skill. Besides being the right thing to do, it can make for more interesting papers and seminars, and can often reveal motivations that have been lost in time.<br>

Rivers are the major source of pollution in the oceans and if we are to clean them up, we first need to know where the majority of the pollution is concentrated. By creating a mathematical model for river outflows – verified by laboratory experiments and fieldwork – the goal is to be able to predict which areas are most susceptible to pollution from rivers and thus coordinate clean-up
operations as effectively as possible.<br>

Abstract: Functional programmers (especially the Haskell ones) are obsessed with making their functions pure, so they resemble mathematical (partial) functions.

<li>Ms J. Yan, “An introduction to descent calculations on elliptic curves”.<br>
Abstract: The explicit rank of the group of rational points of an elliptic curve is a center of interest in computational number theory. This is because the ranks are closely related to explicit rational solutions to certain algebraic equations. One common method of obtaining an upper bound for the rank is via the descent calculation. This talk begins with an introduction to elliptic curves and descent calculation. We will explore how the descent calculation can bound the rank of elliptic curves. In the end, we will briefly discuss some generalisation of this method.</li>
<li>Mr T. G. Marge, “Gaussian Latent Tree Models and their Statistics”.<br>
Abstract: Signal processing strategies and statistics for identifying the presence of evolution in continuous signals is investigated. Consider a feature to be a function on the original signal which contains information about the signal. Under this framework, a model for multivariate Gaussian features observed across related signals is described. The model considers the possibility that some features in the signal are tree amenable while others are not. A model for identifying candidate features using wavelet transforms is also described. Tree amenability is then explored from the perspective of data thresholding. Because of the high type-1 and type-2 error rates of know tests for Gaussian tree amenability, a measure of how tree amenable a feature is has been developed. A methodology is proposed for reconstructing only the tree amenable components of a signal to improve interoperability of the model. Rigorous statistical methods are then defined to test for both tree amenability as well as general structure in the data. To test and better understand these methods, strategies are described to randomly generate tree amenable data.</li>
<li>Mr E.-P. J. Räty, “Intervals in the Hales-Jewett theorem”.<br>
Abstract: The Hales-Jewett theorem for alphabet of size 3 states that whenever the cube {1, 2, 3}^n is r-coloured there exists a monochromatic line for n large. Given a line l, the set of active coordinates of l is the set of those coordinates that are allowed to vary. In this talk I will consider the following question: given r, what is the smallest number t so that for any r-colouring of [3]^n (n large) there exists a monochromatic line whose active set of coordinates is an union of at most t intervals.</li>
<li>Mr S. N. Alperin, “Multiply-Charged Vortices in Nonconservative Quantum Hydrodynamics”.<br>
Abstract: It is well understood that in quantum fluidic systems, rotational flows are restricted to quantized vortex singularities. However, despite being predicted to have extraordinary scientific and technological potential, due to dynamical instabilities, quantized vortices of higher-than-unit topological charge have remained elusive. Here, I show that the steady-state fluxes inherent to nonconservative quantum fluids allow for the spontaneous formation of stable quantum vortices of high topological charge.</li>
<li>Ms M. Tătulea-Codrean, “Locomotion: from basilisk lizards to bacteria”.<br>
Abstract: Swimming, flying, crawling, hopping, gliding, ballooning, cartwheeling… the list could go on. Nature displays an astonishing diversity when it comes to locomotion. In this talk, I will give some examples of interesting locomotion starting from the animal kingdom and ending with the swimming of bacteria, which is the topic of my research. Along the way, I will highlight the role of physics and mathematics in understanding locomotion, and I will refer to some recent research done on this topic.</li>
<li>Mr P. Boyle-Smith, “The importance of Diophantine equations in the Standard Model”.<br>
Abstract: Charges of particles have to be integers. A careful study reveals that for quantum field theory to be consistent, these charges must obey certain sets of polynomial equations. We’ll look at how this plays out beautifully in the Standard Model, and at appearances of discrete mathematics in other related contexts.</li>
<li>Mr G. T. Fortune, “Bubble Sucking Tadpoles and other Animals: Using Mathematical Models to Explain Biological Phenomena”.<br>
Abstract: All across the natural world, organisms perform strange behaviours in order to help them survive in their chosen ecological niche. In this talk, I will chose a couple of such behaviours and discuss the mathematics behind these phenomena. Through constructing simple reduced mathematical models, we are not only able to bring to the surface the key underlying physics but also explain a myrid of experimental observations.</li>

Abstract: According to traditional understanding, quantum particles are either bosons or fermions. This so-called “quantum statistics” has important consequences for their behavior. In the late 70-ies the mathematics of topology was employed to get a deep understanding of quantum statistics, and led to the realization that in two spatial dimensions there are alternatives beyond bosons and fermions. The new possible particles go under the general name “anyons”, coined in 1982. In 1984 it was demonstrated, theoretically, that quasiparticles in the states of matter known as fractional quantum Hall liquids (FQHL) are fractionally charged anyons. Since then, theoretical and numerical work on states of two-dimensional matter has predicted many types of anyons, and in particular “nonabelian” anyons that could be a powerful resource for quantum computers. Until very recently, experiments on anyons lagged far behind the thriving theoretical and numerical work, but this spring, two independent innovative experiments convincingly observed anyon behavior in the simplest FQHL. The age of experimental anyonics is upon us.<br>

Abstract: Long-range, multi-particle quantum entanglement plays a fundamental role in our understanding of many modern quantum materials, including the copper-based high temperature superconductors. Hawking’s quantum information puzzle in the quantum theory of black holes also involves non-local entanglement. I will describe a simple model of randomly entangled qubits which has shed light on these distinct fields of physics.<br>
